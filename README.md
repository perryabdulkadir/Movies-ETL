# Movies-ETL
Columbia Data Science Module 8

In this module, I created an ETL function to read three disparate data files containing movie data. I then extracted and transformed the data from Wikipedia and Kaggle before creating a database in PGAdmin. 

Please note: I tried to upload the .csv files to the resources folder, but even when compressed, they were too large for Github to accept.
