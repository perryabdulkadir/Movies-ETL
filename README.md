# Overview
Columbia Data Science Module 8

In this module, I created an ETL function to read three disparate data files containing movie data. I then extracted and transformed the data from Wikipedia and Kaggle before creating a database in PGAdmin. 

Please note: I tried to upload the .csv files to the resources folder, but even when compressed, they were too large for Github to accept. 

## Tools

Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python

Python packages: json, pandas, numpy, re, sqlalchemy

Data: movies_metadata.csv and ratings.csv from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=ratings.csv), [wikipedia-movies.json](https://github.com/perryabdulkadir/Movies-ETL/blob/main/Resources/wikipedia-movies.json)
